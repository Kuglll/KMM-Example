## KMP Example

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project Example.

In this example we'll try to simulate we have 2 existing apps: iOS and Android. 

Our plan is to:
- Extract shared logic from an existing android app into a KMP module.
- Add the KMP module to the iOS app, that is in other repo.
- Delete ios part of the code that is not needed anymore.

## Project structure

* `/shared` contains the project's code. It has several subfolders:
  - `androidMain` includes android specific code + android app (android app could also be a part of another repo)
  - `commonMain` is for code that's going to be shared between android and ios.
  - `iosMain` includes ios specific code. iOS app is in a separate repo.

## Integration Guide

### Android Integration

The Android app can directly include this KMM module as a dependency in its `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(project(":composeApp"))
}
```

### iOS Integration

The iOS app will be in a separate repository and will integrate this KMM module using KMMBridge and Swift Package Manager (SPM). The integration details will be handled in the iOS app's repository.
